# Dungeon-Master-Part-2
Improved version of the previous project. Now any race of monster can be either magical or physical and not only gain HP the further the player progresses, but the monsters also deal more damage. Items other than Health Potions serve a purpose and the Hero now has gold to spend in a shop.
